        "description":"Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC). Urothelial carcinoma is a type of bladder cancer that begins in cells that line the inside of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, such as part of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra. People with MIUC usually have chemotherapy before surgery, then surgery to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. After surgery, some people receive more treatment to prevent cancer from returning. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Researchers want to learn if giving V940 (the study treatment) with pembrolizumab can prevent MIUC from returning after surgery. V940 (also called mRNA-4157) is designed to treat each person's cancer by helping the person's immune system identify and kill cancer cells based on certain proteins found on those cancer cells.\n\nThe goals of this study are to learn if people who receive V940 and pembrolizumab are alive and cancer free longer than those who receive placebo and pembrolizumab, and to learn about the safety of V940, pembrolizumab, and EV, and if people tolerate them.",

Some patients would also prefer not to take these medications in perpetuity and are likely to struggle with lifelong adherence. These challenges present an opportunity to test alternative interventions, such as meal replacements and behavioral treatments, to support weight maintenance after successful weight loss with GLP-1s.

        "title":"Dinutuximab With Chemotherapy, Surgery and Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Children With Newly Diagnosed High Risk Neuroblastoma",
        "description":"This phase III trial tests how well the addition of dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy works for treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called GD2, which is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but is not present on many healthy or normal cells in the body. When dinutuximab binds to the neuroblastoma cells, it helps signal the immune system to kill the tumor cells. This helps the cells of the immune system kill the cancer cells, this is a type of immunotherapy. When chemotherapy and immunotherapy are given together, during the same treatment cycle, it is called chemoimmunotherapy. This clinical trial randomly assigns patients to receive either standard chemotherapy and surgery or chemoimmunotherapy (chemotherapy plus dinutuximab) and surgery during Induction therapy. Chemotherapy drugs administered during Induction include, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. These drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Upon completion of 5 cycles of Induction therapy, a disease evaluation is completed to determine how well the treatment worked. If the tumor responds to therapy, patients receive a tandem transplantation with stem cell rescue. If the tumor has little improvement or worsens, patients receive chemoimmunotherapy on Extended Induction. During Extended Induction, dinutuximab is given with irinotecan, temozolomide. Patients with a good response to therapy move on to Consolidation therapy, when very high doses of chemotherapy are given at two separate points to kill any remaining cancer cells. Following, transplant, radiation therapy is given to the site where the cancer originated (primary site) and to any other areas that are still active at the end of Induction. The final stage of therapy is Post-Consolidation. During Post-Consolidation, dinutuximab is given with isotretinoin, with the goal of maintaining the response achieved with the previous therapy. Adding dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy may be better at treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.",

This study will assess how safe and effective risankizumab subcutaneous (SC) induction treatment is in treating moderately to severely active CD in adult participants.\n\nRisankizumab is an approved drug for adults with CD. This study comprises of a Period A, a Period B, and a Period C. In Period A, participants are placed in 1 of 2 groups to receive either risankizumab SC Dose A or Placebo. In Period B, based on response, participants will receive risankizumab SC Dose B or Placebo. Participants who do not have improvement in CD symptoms at Week 12 will receive risankizumab SC Dose C and participants with worsening CD symptoms in period B will receive risankizumab SC. In Period C, eligible participants will receive open-label risankizumab SC Dose D. Approximately 276 adult participants with a diagnosis of moderately to severely active CD will be enrolled in approximately 250 sites globally.\n\nParticipants will receive SC induction treatment of risankizumab or matching placebo for up to 24 weeks in Period A and B followed by an open-label risankizumab extension in Period C for 52 weeks.

Many cancerous kidney tumors are indolent and can be followed safely with imaging (i.e., particularly tumors \\<2 cm and in patients with limited life expectancy), while some tumors are both malignant and aggressive, with a higher potential to spread outside the kidney and require treatment.\n\nThe purpose of this observational study is to assess the ability of Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) PET\/MR to distinguish different types of kidney tumors. The investigators hypothesize that PET\/MR will better show differences between aggressive and both indolent and benign kidney masses compared to the currently used radiologic scans.\n\nParticipants will be selected from those who have been scheduled to receive a contrast-enhanced MRI for their regular care due to a suspicious kidney mass. Participants will have their MRI on a hybrid PET\/MR scanner capable of obtaining both MRI and PET images. While they are receiving their standard of care MRI exam, patients will also receive a research FDG PET exam. Participants will have an IV placed for administration of the MRI contrast agent, just as they would if they were not taking part in the study. The same IV will be used to give the FDG radiopharmaceutical for the PET scan and furosemide (a diuretic), to help empty the bladder before the scan and help better see the kidneys on the scans. Both FDG and furosemide are FDA approved medications. Participants will have only one visit with the research team which will last \\~2.5 hours and will include collection of the participant's regularly scheduled MRI.\n\nIf participants undergo surgery to remove the tumor, the study will collect samples of the removed tissue for research. If participants receive a biopsy of the tumor, the study may collect an additional sample of the tumor for research.\n\nAfter the PET\/MRI, participants will not have additional visits with the study team, but the study team may call every 6-12 months for up to 2 years to see how they are doing and ask about their health. The study team will review the medical record for any changes to their diagnosis, updates to their medical history, new scans ordered by their regular doctor, or recent lab or biopsy results.",

Many types of tumors tend to lose cells or release different types of cellular products including their DNA which is referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the bloodstream before changes can be seen on scans. Health care providers can measure the level of ctDNA in blood or other bodily fluids to determine which patients are at higher risk for disease progression or relapse. In this study, a blood test is used to measure ctDNA and see if there is still cancer somewhere in the body after surgery and if giving a treatment will help eliminate the cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and relatlimab, can help the body's immune system to attack the cancer, and can interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial may help doctors determine if ctDNA measurement in blood can better identify patients that need additional treatment, if treatment with nivolumab prolongs patients' life and whether the additional immunotherapy treatment with relatlimab extends time without disease progression or prolongs life of bladder cancer patients who have undergone surgical removal of their bladder.",

        "description":"This phase II trial compares tuvusertib in combination with avelumab to tuvusertib alone to determine whether the combination therapy will lengthen the time before the cancer starts getting worse in patients with Merkel cell cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Tuvusertib is a drug that inhibits an enzyme called ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase, which is an enzyme that plays a role in repair of damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as tumor cell replication and survival. It may lead to tumor cell death by inhibiting ATR kinase activity. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tuvusertib in combination with avelumab may lengthen the time before Merkel cell cancer starts getting worse compared to giving avelumab alone.",

        "title":"Sonocloud-9 in Association With Carboplatin Versus Standard-of-Care Chemotherapies (CCNU or TMZ) in Recurrent GBM (SONOBIRD)",
        "description":"The brain is protected from any toxic or inflammatory molecule by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This physical barrier is located at the level of the blood vessel walls. Because of these barrier properties, the blood vessels are also impermeable to the passage of therapeutic molecules from the blood to the brain. The development of effective treatments against glioblastoma is thus limited due to the BBB that prevents most drugs injected in the bloodstream from getting into brain tissue where the tumour is seated. The SonoCloud-9 (SC9) is an investigational device using ultrasound technology and specially developed to open the BBB in the area of and surrounding the tumour. The transient opening of the BBB allows more drugs to reach the brain tumour tissue. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy that is approved to treat different cancer types alone or in combination with other drugs, and has been used in the treatment of glioblastoma. Despite its proven efficacy in the laboratory on glioblastoma cells, carboplatin does not readily cross the BBB in humans. A clinical trial has shown that in combination with the SonoCloud-9, more carboplatin can reach the brain tumour tissue. The objective of the proposed trial is to show that the association - carboplatin with the SonoCloud-9 - will increase efficacy of the drug in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",

        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effect of stero-ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) followed by standard of care systemic therapy, to standard of care systemic therapy alone, in patients with kidney cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to a limited (2-5) number of places in the body (metastatic). Study doctors want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for metastatic kidney cancer. The usual approach is defined as the care most people get for metastatic kidney cancer which includes systemic therapy such as immunotherapy (given through the veins) and\/or small molecular inhibitor (tablets taken by mouth). Radiotherapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. SAbR uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. Giving SAbR prior to systemic therapy may kill more tumor cells than the usual approach, which is systemic therapy alone.",

        "title":"Optimization of Saturation Targets and Resuscitation Trial (OptiSTART) (OptiSTART)",
        "description":"This study is designed to answer one of the fundamental gaps in knowledge in the resuscitation of preterm infants at birth: What is the optimal target oxygen saturation (SpO2) range that increases survival without long-term morbidities? Oxygen (O2) is routinely used for the stabilization of preterm infants in the delivery room (DR), but its use is linked with mortality and several morbidities including bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). To balance the need to give sufficient O2 to correct hypoxia and avoid excess O2, the neonatal resuscitation program (NRP) recommends initiating preterm resuscitation with low (\u2264 30%) inspired O2 concentration (FiO2) and subsequent titration to achieve a specified target SpO2 range. These SpO2 targets are based on approximated 50th percentile SpO2 (Sat50) observed in healthy term infants. However, the optimal SpO2 targets remain undefined in the preterm infants. Recent data suggest that the current SpO2 targets (Sat50) may be too low. The investigators plan to conduct a multicenter RCT of Sat75 versus Sat50 powered for survival without BPD. The investigators will randomize 700 infants, 23 0\/7- 30 6\/7 weeks' GA, to 75th percentile SpO2 goals (Sat75, Intervention) or 50th percentile SpO2 goals (Sat50, control). Except for the SpO2 targets, all resuscitations will follow NRP guidelines including an initial FiO2 of 0.3. In Aim 1, the investigators will determine whether targeting Sat75 compared to Sat50 increases survival without lung disease (BPD). In addition, the investigators will compare the rates of other major morbidities such as IVH. In Aim 2, the investigators will determine whether targeting Sat75 compared to Sat50 increases survival without neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years of age. In Aim 3, the investigators will determine whether targeting Sat75 compared to Sat50 decreases oxidative stress.",

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a type of disease that occurs when the body makes too many immature Langerhans cells (a type of white blood cell). When these cells build up, they can form tumors in certain tissues and organs including bones, skin, lungs and pituitary gland and can damage them. This tumor is more common in children and young adults. DAY101 may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Using DAY101 may be effective in treating patients with relapsed or refractory Langerhans cell histiocytosis.",

        "title":"A Study to Compare Darolutamide Given With Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) With ADT in Men With Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer and Raise of Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Levels After Local Therapies (ARASTEP)",
        "description":"Researchers are looking for a better way to treat men at high-risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) of prostate cancer.\n\nBCR means that in men who had prostate cancer and were treated by either surgery and\/ or radiation therapy, the blood level of a specific protein called PSA rises. PSA is a marker of prostate cancer cells activity. The PSA increase means that the cancer has come back even though conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bone scans does not show any lesion of prostate cancer. Recently a more sensitive imaging method called prostate-specific membrane antigen \\[PSMA\\] positron emission tomography \\[PET\\]) \/computed tomography \\[CT\\]) scan may identify prostate cancer lesions not detectable by conventional imaging. Men with BCR have a higher risk of their cancer spreading to other parts of the body, particularly when PSA levels raised to a certain limit within a short period of time after local therapies. Once the cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it can become even harder to treat.\n\nIn men with prostate cancer, male sex hormones (also called androgens) like testosterone can help the cancer grow and spread. To reduce androgens levels in these patients, there are treatments that block androgens production in the body called androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT is often used to stop prostate cancer. Another way to stop prostate cancer growth and spread is to block the action of androgen receptors on prostate cancer cells called androgen receptor inhibitors (ARIs). The new generation ARIs including darolutamide can block the action of androgens receptors and are available for the treatment of prostate cancer in addition to ADT. It is already known that men with prostate cancer benefit from these treatments.\n\nThe main objective of this study is to learn if the combination of darolutamide and ADT prolongs the time that the participants live without their cancer getting worse, or to death due to any cause, compared to placebo (which is a treatment that looks like a medicine but does not have any medicine in it) and ADT given for a pre-specified duration of 24 months.\n\nTo do this, the study team will measure the time from the date of treatment allocation to the finding of new cancer spread in the participants by using PSMA PET\/CT, or death due to any cause. The PSMA PET\/CT scans is performed using a radioactive substance called a \"tracer\" that specifically binds to the prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) which is a protein often found in large amounts on prostate cancer cells.\n\nTo avoid bias in treatment, the study participants will be randomly (by chance) allocated to one of two treatment groups. Based on the allocated treatment group, the participants will either take darolutamide plus ADT or placebo plus ADT twice daily as tablets by mouth. The study will consist of a test (screening) phase, a treatment phase and a follow-up phase. The treatment duration is pre-specified to be 24 months unless the cancer gets worse, the participants have medical problems, or they leave the study for any reason. In addition, image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) or surgery is allowed and your doctor will explain the benefits and risks of this type of therapy.\n\nDuring the study, the study team will:\n\n* take blood and urine samples.\n* measure PSA and testosterone levels in the blood samples\n* do physical examinations\n* check the participants' overall health\n* examine heart health using electrocardiogram (ECG)\n* check vital signs\n* check cancer status using PSMA PET\/CT scans, CT, MRI and bone scans\n* take tumor samples (if required)\n* ask the participants if they have medical problems\n\nAbout 30 days after the participants have taken their last treatment, the study doctors and their team will check the participants' health and if their cancer worsened. The study team will continue to check this and regularly ask the participants questions about medical problems and subse",

        "title":"A Study of Revumenib in Combination With Chemotherapy for Patients Diagnosed With Relapsed or Refractory Leukemia",
        "description":"This phase II trial tests the safety and best dose of revumenib in combination with chemotherapy, and evaluates whether this treatment improves the outcome in infants and young children who have leukemia that has come back (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory) and is associated with a KMT2A (MLL) gene rearrangement (KMT2A-R). Leukemia is a cancer of the white blood cells, where too many underdeveloped (abnormal) white blood cells, called \"blasts\", are found in the bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy center of the bones that produces the three major blood cells: white blood cells to fight infection; red blood cells that carry oxygen; and platelets that help blood clot and stop bleeding. The blasts crowd out the normal blood cells in the bone marrow and spread to the blood. They can also spread to the brain, spinal cord, and\/or other organs of the body. The leukemia cells of some children have a genetic change in which a gene (KMT2A) is broken and combined with other genes that typically do not interact with one another; this is called \"rearranged\". This genetic rearrangement alters how other genes are turned on or off in the cell, turning on genes that drive the development of leukemia. Patients with KMT2A rearrangement have higher risk for cancer coming back after treatment. Revumenib is an oral medicine that directly targets the changes that occur in a cell with a KMT2A rearrangement and has been shown to specifically kill these leukemia cells in preclinical laboratory settings and in animals. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as vincristine, prednisone, asparaginase, fludarabine and cytarabine work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial is being done to find out if the combination of revumenib and chemotherapy would be safe and\/or effective in treating infants and young children with relapsed or refractory KMT2A-R leukemia.",

        "description":"This phase II trial studies how well lutetium Lu 177 dotatate works in treating patients with prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Neuroendocrine differentiation refers to cells that have traits of both hormone-producing endocrine cells and nerve cells. These cells release hormones into the blood in response to a signal from the nervous system. Hormones are biological substances that circulate through the bloodstream to control the activity of other organs or cells in the body. Lutetium Lu 177-dotatate is a radioactive drug. It binds to a protein called somatostatin receptor, which is found on some neuroendocrine tumor cells. Lutetium Lu 177-dotatate builds up in these cells and gives off radiation that may kill them. It is a type of radioconjugate and a type of somatostatin analog. Treatment with Lutetium Lu 177 dotatate may shrink the tumor in a way that can be measured in patients with metastatic prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation.",

        "title":"A Study to Compare Standard Therapy to Treat Hodgkin Lymphoma to the Use of Two Drugs, Brentuximab Vedotin and Nivolumab",
        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effect of adding immunotherapy (brentuximab vedotin and nivolumab) to standard treatment (chemotherapy with or without radiation) to the standard treatment alone in improving survival in patients with stage I and II classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab vedotin is in a class of medications called antibody-drug conjugates. It is made of a monoclonal antibody called brentuximab that is linked to a cytotoxic agent called vedotin. Brentuximab attaches to CD30 positive lymphoma cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. A monoclonal antibody is a type of protein that can bind to certain targets in the body, such as molecules that cause the body to make an immune response (antigens). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs such as doxorubicin hydrochloride, bleomycin sulfate, vinblastine sulfate, dacarbazine, and procarbazine hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Prednisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It is used to reduce inflammation and lower the body's immune response to help lessen the side effects of chemotherapy drugs. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Adding immunotherapy to the standard treatment of chemotherapy with or without radiation may increase survival and\/or fewer short-term or long-term side effects in patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma compared to the standard treatment alone.",

        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effect of modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (mFOLFIRINOX) to modified fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX) for the treatment of advanced, unresectable, or metastatic HER2 negative esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, and gastric adenocarcinoma. The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.",

        "description":"This phase II trial tests how well canakinumab works to prevent progression to cancer in patients with clonal cytopenias of unknown significance (CCUS). CCUS is a blood condition defined by a decrease in blood cells. Blood cells are composed of either red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. In patients with CCUS, blood counts have been low for a long period of time. Patients with CCUS also have a mutation in one of the genes that are responsible for helping blood cells develop. The combination of genetic mutations and low blood cell counts puts patients with CCUS at a higher risk to develop blood cancers in the future. This transformation from low blood cell counts to cancer may be caused by inflammation in the body. Canakinumab is a monoclonal antibody that may block inflammation in the body by targeting a specific antibody called the anti-human interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta).",

        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effect of adding levocarnitine to standard chemotherapy versus (vs.) standard chemotherapy alone in protecting the liver in patients with leukemia or lymphoma. Asparaginase is part of the standard of care chemotherapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL), and mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL). However, in adolescent and young adults (AYA) ages 15-39 years, liver toxicity from asparaginase is common and often prevents delivery of planned chemotherapy, thereby potentially compromising outcomes. Some groups of people may also be at higher risk for liver damage due to the presence of fat in the liver even before starting chemotherapy. Patients who are of Japanese descent, Native Hawaiian, Hispanic or Latinx may be at greater risk for liver damage from chemotherapy for this reason. Carnitine is a naturally occurring nutrient that is part of a typical diet and is also made by the body. Carnitine is necessary for metabolism and its deficiency or absence is associated with liver and other organ damage. Levocarnitine is a drug used to provide extra carnitine. Laboratory and real-world usage of the dietary supplement levocarnitine suggests its potential to prevent or reduce liver toxicity from asparaginase. The overall goal of this study is to determine whether adding levocarnitine to standard of care chemotherapy will reduce the chance of developing severe liver damage from asparaginase chemotherapy in ALL, LL and\/or MPAL patients.",

Ipatasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells and may kill them by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Megestrol acetate lowers the amount of estrogen and also blocks the use of estrogen made by the body. This may help stop the growth of tumor cells that need estrogen to grow. The combination of ipatasertib and megestrol acetate may be more effective in treating endometrial cancer than megestrol acetate alone.",

        "description":"Patent Ductus Arteriosus is a developmental condition commonly observed among preterm infants. It is a condition where the opening between the two major blood vessels leading from the heart fail to close after birth. In the womb, the opening (ductus arteriosus) is the normal part of the circulatory system of the baby, but is expected to close at full term birth. If the opening is tiny, the condition can be self-limiting. If not, medications\/surgery are options for treatment.\n\nThere are two ways to treat patent ductus arteriosus - one is through closure of the opening with an FDA approved device called PICCOLO, the other is through supportive management (medications). No randomized controlled trials have been done previously to see if one of better than the other. Through our PIVOTAL study, the investigators aim to determine is one is indeed better than the other - if it is found that the percutaneous closure with PICCOLO is better, then it would immediately lead to a new standard of care. If not, then the investigators avoid an invasive costly procedure going forward.",

        "title":"Treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea With Personalized Surgery in Children With Down Syndrome (TOPS-DS) (TOPS-DS)",
        "description":"The overall objective of this randomized clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of a personalized approach to the surgical treatment of OSA in children with Down syndrome (DS).The estimated prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children with DS ranges from 45-83%, compared to 1-6% in the general pediatric population. Untreated OSA in children has been associated with daytime sleepiness, cognitive or behavioral problems, and cardiovascular complications, all which are common in children with DS. Adenotonsillectomy (AT) is the first line treatment for OSA in children, however, most large studies of AT outcomes have excluded children with DS. Available evidence demonstrates that AT is far less effective in children with DS than in the general pediatric population, with 48 to 95% of children with DS having persistent OSA after AT. Medical treatments such as positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy are frequently inadequate or poorly tolerated in this population, so many children with DS and OSA remain untreated. Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) enables direct observation of the sites and patterns of obstruction during sedated sleep using a flexible endoscope passed through the nose into the pharynx. DISE was developed to guide surgical decisions in adult OSA, and in recent years has also been used to design personalized surgical interventions in children. Using this DISE Rating Scale, the investigators have demonstrated that children with DS are more prone to tongue base and supraglottic obstruction than non-DS children, suggesting the need for more personalized surgical treatments that are tailored to the common sources of obstruction in this population. Several small case series demonstrate that DISE-directed surgery can be effective in treating OSA in children with DS. However, because there have been few prospective studies and no randomized trials comparing different treatment options in this population, there remains uncertainty about whether such a personalized approach leads to superior outcomes compared to the first line AT.\n\nIt is the investigators' hypothesis that personalized DISE-directed surgery that uses existing procedures to address specific fixed and dynamic anatomic features causing obstruction in each child with DS will be superior to the current first line approach of AT. This novel approach may improve OSA outcomes and reduce the burden of unnecessary AT or secondary surgery for persistent OSA after an ineffective AT.",

        "title":"A Study to Give Treatment Inside the Eye to Treat Retinoblastoma",
        "description":"This phase II trial tests the safety and side effects of adding melphalan (by injecting it into the eye) to standard chemotherapy in early treatment of patients with retinoblastoma (RB). RB is a type of cancer that forms in the tissues of the retina (the light-sensitive layers of nerve tissue at the back of the eye). It may be hereditary or nonhereditary (sporadic). RB is considered harder to treat (higher risk) when there are vitreous seeds present. Vitreous seeds are RB tumors in the jelly-like fluid of the eye (called the vitreous humor). The term, risk, refers to the chance of the cancer not responding to treatment or coming back after treatment. Melphalan is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It may kill cancer cells by damaging their deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and stopping them from dividing. Other chemotherapy drugs given during this trial include carboplatin, vincristine, and etoposide. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Vincristine is in a class of medications called vinca alkaloids. It works by stopping cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair and may kill cancer cells. Adding melphalan to standard chemotherapy early in treatment may improve the ability to treat vitreous seeds and may be better than standard chemotherapy alone in treating retinoblastoma.",

        "title":"Safety, Efficacy, and Pharmacokinetics of Tafamidis in Patients with Transthyretin-mediated Amyloidosis Post Orthotopic Heart Transplantation",
        "description":"Transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) is a relentlessly progressive disease that can progress to end stage heart failure, at which point recently approved transthyretin production silencing or structure stabilizing therapies provide no clinical benefit. For well-selected individuals, heart transplantation is an excellent therapeutic option to improve survival. Historically, concomitant liver transplantation has been used to halt the progression of non-cardiac transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR) manifestations, especially for individuals with TTR genotypes associated with significant neuropathy. However, despite this, patients continue to experience progressive non-cardiac manifestations, particularly gastrointestinal and neuropathic, which can have a substantial influence on post-heart transplantation morbidity. Concomitant liver transplantation is also associated with substantial morbidity and its future therapeutic role is questionable with recently established therapies for ATTR. Therefore, there is a clear unmet need to determine the utility and safety of ATTR targeted therapies for patients with recent heart transplantation for end-stage ATTR-CA. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that in patients who have received a heart transplantation for end-stage ATTR-CA, tafamidis therapy will be efficacious and well-tolerated. We aim to determine the safety and efficacy of tafamidis in stable patients who have undergone heart or combined heart\/liver transplantation for ATTR (wild-type or variant) cardiac amyloidosis. The proposed study will be a single-arm intervention clinical trial with tafamidis. Because of the efficacy of tafamidis for both variant ATTR-CA and wild-type ATTR-CA, there is no clinical equipoise for an inactive-comparator placebo arm. The primary endpoint of this study will be serial change in plasma transthyretin (TTR) levels from baseline to 12 months at 3-month intervals. The secondary endpoints of this study will include serial changes in neuropathy assessments, modified body mass indices, incident transplant-specific adverse events, and pharmacokinetics of tafamidis. Observations from this study will establish the role of tafamidis use for the management of ATTR in patients after transplantation for end-stage ATTR-CA.",

        "title":"Subclinical Transthyretin Cardiac Amyloidosis in V122I TTR Carriers",
        "description":"Approximately 1.5 million of the 44 million Blacks in the United States are carriers of the valine-to-isoleucine substitution at position 122 (V122I) in the transthyretin (TTR) protein. Virtually exclusive to Blacks, this is the most common cause of hereditary cardiac amyloidosis (hATTR-CA) worldwide. hATTR-CA leads to worsening heart failure (HF) and premature death. Fortunately, new therapies that stabilize TTR improve morbidity and mortality in hATTR-CA, especially when prescribed early in the disease. However, hATTR-CA is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and conventional diagnostic tools lack diagnostic specificity to detect early disease.\n\nThe overall objectives of this study are to determine the presence of subclinical hATTR-CA and to identify biomarkers that indicate amyloid progression in V122I TTR carriers. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that hATTR-CA has a long latency period that will be detected through subclinical amyloidosis imaging and biomarker phenotyping.\n\nThe central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 2 specific aims: Aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with CMRI evidence of amyloid infiltration; Sub-aim 1) determine the association of V122I TTR carrier status with cardiac reserve; Aim 2) determine the association between amyloid-specific biomarkers and V122I TTR carrier status; and Sub-aim 2) determine the association of amyloid-specific biomarkers with imaging-based parameters and evaluate their diagnostic utility for identifying subclinical hATTR-CA. In Aim 1, CMRI will be used to compare metrics associated with cardiac amyloid infiltration between a cohort of V122I TTR carriers without HF formed by cascade genetic testing and age-, sex-, and race-matched non-carrier controls. For Sub-Aim 1, a sub-sample of carriers and non-carrier controls enrolled in Aim 1 will undergo novel exercise CMRI to measure and compare cardiac systolic and diastolic reserve. Aim 2 involves measuring and comparing amyloid-specific biomarkers in V122I TTR carriers without HF with samples matched non-carriers (both from Aim 1) and individuals with symptomatic V122I hATTR-CA from our clinical sites. These biomarkers detect and quantify different processes of TTR amyloidogenesis and include circulating TTR, retinol binding protein 4, TTR kinetic stability, and misfolded TTR oligomers. Sub-aim 2 will establish the role of these biomarkers to detect imaging evidence of subclinical hATTR-CA disease.",

HCT is considered standard of care treatment for patients with high-risk acute leukemia and MDS. In HCT, patients are given very high doses of chemotherapy and\/or radiation therapy, which is intended to kill cancer cells that may be resistant to more standard doses of chemotherapy; unfortunately, this also destroys the normal cells in the bone marrow, including stem cells. After the treatment, patients must have a healthy supply of stem cells reintroduced or transplanted. The transplanted cells then reestablish the blood cell production process in the bone marrow. The healthy stem cells may come from the blood or bone marrow of a related or unrelated donor. If patients do not have a matched related donor, doctors do not know what the next best donor choice is. This trial may help researchers understand whether a haplo related donor or a MUD HCT for children with acute leukemia or MDS is better or if there is no difference at all.",

        "description":"This phase II trial compares the effect of atezolizumab in combination with usual treatment with cabozantinib to cabozantinib alone in patients with papillary renal cell carcinoma that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is a type of kidney cancer that forms in the lining of the tiny tubes in the kidney that return filtered substances that the body needs back to the blood and remove extra fluid and waste as urine. Most papillary tumors look like long, thin finger-like growths under a microscope. It is also called papillary kidney cancer or PRCC. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the tumor and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cabozantinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals tumor cells to multiply and may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. By these actions it may help slow or stop the spread of tumor cells. Combination therapy with atezolizumab and cabozantinib may shrink the tumor and allow a longer survival time in patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma.",

XEN45 implanted using the ab externo approach (outside the eye) is being studied in this study. Approximately 65 participants aged 45 years or older with open-angle glaucoma will be enrolled in this study at approximately 22 sites in the United States.\n\nAll participants will receive XEN45 implanted using the ab externo approach on Day 1 and will be followed for 12 months.\n\nParticipants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or clinic. The safety and effect of the gel stent on your glaucoma will be checked by medical assessments and eye examinations.",

        "description":"Claudin 18.2 protein, or CLDN18.2 is a protein found on cells in the digestive system. It is also found on some tumors. Researchers are looking at ways to attack CLDN18.2 to help control tumors. ASP2138 is thought to bind to CLDN18.2 and a protein on a type of immune cell called a T-cell. This \"tells\" the immune system to attack the tumor. ASP2138 is a potential treatment for people with stomach cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJ cancer) or pancreatic cancer. GEJ is where the tube that carries food (esophagus) joins the stomach. Before ASP2138 is available as a treatment, the researchers need to understand how it is processed by and acts upon the body. In this study, ASP2138 will either be given by itself, or given together with standard treatments for gastric, GEJ and pancreatic cancer. Pembrolizumab and mFOLFOX6, and ramucirumab and paclitaxel are standard treatments for gastric and GEJ cancer. mFOLFIRINOX is a standard treatment for pancreatic cancer. This information will help find a suitable dose of ASP2138 given by itself and together with the standard cancer treatments and to check for potential medical problems from the treatments.\n\nThe main aims of the study are:\n\n* To check the safety of ASP2138 and how well people can tolerate medical problems during the study.\n* To find a suitable dose of ASP2138 to be used later in the study.\n* These are done for ASP2138 given by itself and when given together with the standard cancer treatments.\n\nAdults 18 years or older with stomach cancer, GEJ cancer, or pancreatic cancer can take part. Their cancer is locally advanced unresectable or metastatic. Locally advanced means the cancer has spread to nearby tissue. Unresectable means the cancer cannot be removed by surgery. Metastatic means the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. There should also be the CLDN18.2 marker in a tumor sample. People cannot take part if they need to take medicines to suppress their immune system, have blockages or bleeding in their gut, have specific uncontrollable cancers, have specific infections, have a condition such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) which is when the body over-reacts to a \"trigger\" such as infection, or have a specific heart condition (\"New York Heart Association Class III or IV\").\n\nPhase 1: Lower to higher doses of ASP2138\n\n* ASP2138 is either given through a vein (intravenous infusion) or just under the skin (subcutaneous injection).\n* Different small groups are given lower to higher doses of ASAP2138.\n* ASP2138 is either given by itself, or given with 1 of 3 standard treatments:\n* Pembrolizumab and mFOLFOX6 (first treatment for gastric GEJ cancer)\n* Ramacirumab and paclitaxel (Second treatment for gastric or GEJ cancer)\n* ASP2138 with mFOLFIRINOX (first treatment for pancreatic cancer)\n\nPhase 1b: doses of ASP2138 worked out from Phase 1\n\n* ASP2138 is either given through a vein or just under the skin. This depends on the findings from Phase 1.\n* People with gastric cancer, GEJ cancer or pancreatic cancer are given doses of ASP2138, worked out from Phase 1.\n* This includes doses of ASP2138 given by itself and ASP2138 given with the standard cancer treatments.\n* The standard cancer treatments given depends on the type of cancer they have.\n\nEnd of treatment visit: This is 7 days after final dose of study treatment or if the study doctor decides to stop the person's treatment.\n\nPeople who have locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer will not receive ASP2138 by itself.",

        "description":"This phase II trial tests whether using genetic testing of tumor tissue to select the optimal treatment regimen works in treating patients with clear cell renal cell (kidney) cancer that has spread to other places in the body (advanced or metastatic). The current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved regimens for advanced kidney cancer fall into two categories. One treatment combination includes two immunotherapy drugs (nivolumab plus ipilimumab), which are delivered by separate intravenous infusions into a vein. The other combination is one immunotherapy drug (nivolumab infusion) plus an oral pill taken by mouth (cabozantinib). Nivolumab and ipilimumab are \"immunotherapies\" which release the brakes of the immune system, thus allowing the patient's own immune system to better kill cancer cells. Cabozantinib is a \"targeted therapy\" specifically designed to block certain biological mechanisms needed for growth of cancer cells. In kidney cancer, cabozantinib blocks a tumor's blood supply. The genetic (DNA) makeup of the tumor may affect how well it responds to therapy. Testing the makeup (genes) of the tumor, may help match a treatment (from one of the above two treatment options) to the specific cancer and increase the chance that the disease will respond to treatment. The purpose of this study is to learn if genetic testing of tumor tissue may help doctors select the optimal treatment regimen to which advanced kidney cancer is more likely to respond.",

Tazemetostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as topotecan, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving tazemetostat in combination with topotecan and pembrolizumab may shrink or stabilize recurrent small cell lung cancer.",

        "description":"This phase II trial tests whether the addition of radiation to the primary tumor, typically given with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (SABR), in combination with standard of care immunotherapy improves outcomes in patients with renal cell cancer that is not recommended for surgery and has spread to other places in the body (metastatic). Radiation therapy uses high energy photons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses of radiation over a shorter period and cause less damage to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, ipilimumab, avelumab, and pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Axitinib, cabozantinib, and lenvatinib are in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. They work by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving SABR in combination with standard of care immunotherapy may help shrink or stabilize the cancer in patients with renal cell cancer.",

This phase III trial aims to maintain excellent outcomes in patients with very low risk rhabdomyosarcoma (VLR-RMS) while decreasing the burden of therapy using treatment with 24 weeks of vincristine and dactinomycin (VA) and examines the use of centralized molecular risk stratification in the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma. Another aim of the study it to find out how well patients with low risk rhabdomyosarcoma (LR-RMS) respond to standard chemotherapy when patients with VLR-RMS and patients who have rhabdomyosarcoma with DNA mutations get separate treatment. Finally, this study examines the effect of therapy intensification in patients who have RMS cancer with DNA mutations to see if their outcomes can be improved.",

Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) mismatch repair (MMR) is a system for recognizing and repairing damaged DNA. In 2-3% of endometrial cancers this may be due to a hereditary condition resulted from gene mutation called Lynch Syndrome (previously called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC). MMR deficient cells usually have many DNA mutations. Tumors that have evidence of mismatch repair deficiency tend to be more sensitive to immunotherapy. There is some evidence that nivolumab with ipilimumab can shrink or stabilize cancers with deficient mismatch repair system. However, it is not known whether this will happen in endometrial cancer; therefore, this study is designed to answer that question. Monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab may be better than nivolumab alone in treating dMMR recurrent endometrial carcinoma.",

        "description":"This phase II\/III trial compares the effect of immunotherapy with atezolizumab in combination with standard chemotherapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide versus standard therapy alone for the treatment of poorly differentiated extrapulmonary (originated outside the lung) neuroendocrine cancer that may have spread from where it first started to nearby tissue, lymph nodes, or distant parts of the body (advanced) or that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic). The other aim of this trial is to compare using atezolizumab just at the beginning of treatment versus continuing it beyond the initial treatment. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Cisplatin and carboplatin are in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds that work by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Etoposide is in a class of medications known as podophyllotoxin derivatives. It blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill cancer cells. Giving atezolizumab in combination with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide may work better in treating patients with poorly differentiated extrapulmonary neuroendocrine cancer compared to standard therapy with a platinum drug (cisplatin or carboplatin) and etoposide alone.",

Patients with higher Decipher risk score will be assigned to the part of the study that compares the use of 6 months of the usual treatment (hormone therapy and radiation treatment) to the use of darolutamide plus the usual treatment (intensification). The purpose of this section of the study is to determine whether the additional drug can reduce the chance of cancer coming back and spreading in patients with higher Decipher score. The addition of darolutamide to the usual treatment may better control the cancer and prevent it from spreading. Alternatively, patients with low Decipher risk score will be assigned to the part of the study that compares the use of radiation treatment alone (de-intensification) to the usual approach (6 months of hormone therapy plus radiation). The purpose of this part of the study is to determine if radiation treatment alone is as effective compared to the usual treatment without affecting the chance of tumor coming back in patients with low Decipher score prostate cancer. Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill tumor cells and reduce the tumor size. Hormone therapy drugs such as darolutamide suppress or block the production or action of male hormones that play role in prostate cancer development. Effect of radiation treatment alone in patients with low Decipher score prostate cancer could be the same as the usual approach in stabilizing prostate cancer and preventing it from spreading, while avoiding the side effects associated with hormonal therapy.",

Erdafitinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal FGFR protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. Enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, enfortumab, linked to an anticancer drug called vedotin. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the growth of cancer cells. Enfortumab attaches to a protein called nectin-4 on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers vedotin to kill them. It is a type of antibody-drug conjugate. Giving erdafitinib in combination with enfortumab vedotin may shrink or stabilize metastatic bladder cancer with alterations in FGFR 2\/3 genes.",

        "description":"The brain networks controlling movement are complex, involving multiple areas of the brain. Some neurological disorders, like Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET), cause abnormalities in these brain networks. Deep brain stimulation is a treatment that is used to treat these types of neurological diseases and is thought to help patients by modulating brain networks responsible for movement. Levodopa medication is also used to modulate this brain networks in patients with PD. The overall objective is to develop a unified theory of basal ganglia thalamocortical (BGTC) circuit dynamics that accounts for disease symptomatology, movement, and their inter-relationship. The underlying hypothesis, is that the rigidity and bradykinesia of PD are fundamentally related to excessive functional coupling across nodes in the BGTC motor circuit impeding effective information flow. In this research, the investigator will take advantage of the unique opportunity provided by awake deep brain stimulation surgery to learn more about how the brain functions in a diseased state and how deep brain stimulation changes these networks to make movement more normal. The investigator will simultaneously assess cortical and subcortical electrophysiology in relation to clinical symptoms and behavioral measures and in response to deep brain stimulation, cortical stimulation, and pharmacologic therapy in patients undergoing Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) implantation surgery.",

        "title":"Aging and Disease Course: Contributions to Lifespan Neurobiology of Schizophrenia",
        "description":"The 2020 NIMH Strategic Plan for Research calls for investigations targeting neurobiology of mental illness across the lifespan. Growing evidence suggests that lifespan neurobiology of schizophrenia (SZ) incorporates two distinct dimensions: aging and disease course. However, their clinical correlates, associated biomarker trajectories, and implications for treatment are unknown. This study will investigate differential aspects of SZ neurobiology captured by aging and disease course, in order to develop specific biomarkers which may offer actionable targets for SZ stage-dependent intervention. The study is predicated on a novel mechanistic Model of SZ Trajectories across the Adult Lifespan, positing distinct biological fingerprints within the anterior limbic system for aging and disease course in SZ: (1) alterations in the circuit's function and structure that occur earlier in the lifespan and are larger in magnitude than the alterations expected with normal aging (accelerated aging dimension); and (2) regionally-specific anterior limbic \"hyperactivity\" in early SZ, with a subsequent transformation into \"hypoactivity\" in advanced SZ (disease course dimension). In a sample of SZ and matched healthy controls (n=168, 84\/group) aged 18-75 years the investigators will ascertain a broad panel of biomarkers \\[via multimodal brain imaging: optimized 1H-MRS, high-resolution task-based fMRI, perfusion (Vascular Space Occupancy) and structural MRI\\], along with comprehensive cognitive and clinical assessments. All measures will be acquired at baseline and repeated at 2-year longitudinal follow-up. Using cutting-edge computational approaches, the study will examine (i) effects of aging and SZ course on anterior limbic system biomarkers; (ii) lifespan trajectories for different biomarkers; (iii) patterns of limbic system biomarkers in age- and SZ course-based subgroups (e.g., Younger vs. Older, Early-Course vs. Advanced SZ), as well as in data-driven subgroups (e.g., those with vs. without accelerated aging profiles); and (iv) associations between biomarkers and cognitive and clinical outcomes. This research will advance the field by providing novel biomarkers that capture unique neurobiological contributions of aging and disease course in SZ, and will motivate future studies on SZ mechanisms across the lifespan and development of precision treatments.",

These data may promote DOR as a robust \"HDL friendly\" and \"metabolism friendly\", therapeutic agent that may attenuate morbidity in chronic treated HIV infection.

        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effects of nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy versus chemo-immunotherapy alone in treating patients with newly diagnosed primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL). Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Treatment for PMBCL involves chemotherapy combined with an immunotherapy called rituximab. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody. It binds to a protein called CD20, which is found on B cells (a type of white blood cell) and some types of cancer cells. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Giving nivolumab with chemo-immunotherapy may help treat patients with PMBCL.",

The dose expansion phase (phase Ib) of this trial compares how colorectal and gastroesophageal cancers with HER2 mutation respond to treatment with a combination of ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan versus trastuzumab deruxtecan alone. Ceralasertib may stop the growth of tumor cells and may kill them by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 positive cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Ceralasertib and trastuzumab deruxtecan may be safe, tolerable and effective in treating patients with advanced solid tumors expressing the HER2 protein or gene.",

        "description":"This phase II trial studies the best approach to combine chemotherapy and radiation therapy (RT) based on the patient's response to induction chemotherapy in patients with non-germinomatous germ cell tumors (NGGCT) that have not spread to other parts of the brain or body (localized). This study has 2 goals: 1) optimizing radiation for patients who respond well to induction chemotherapy to diminish spinal cord relapses, 2) utilizing higher dose chemotherapy followed by conventional RT in patients who did not respond to induction chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin, etoposide, ifosfamide, and thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays or high-energy protons to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Studies have shown that patients with newly-diagnosed localized NGGCT, whose disease responds well to chemotherapy before receiving radiation therapy, are more likely to be free of the disease for a longer time than are patients for whom the chemotherapy does not efficiently eliminate or reduce the size of the tumor. The purpose of this study is to see how well the tumors respond to induction chemotherapy to decide what treatment to give next. Some patients will be given RT to the spine and a portion of the brain. Others will be given high dose chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant before RT to the whole brain and spine. Giving treatment based on the response to induction chemotherapy may lower the side effects of radiation in some patients and adjust the therapy to a more efficient one for other patients with localized NGGCT.",

Lenalidomide may stop or slow primary CNS lymphoma by blocking the growth of new blood vessels necessary for tumor growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that may interfere with the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Methotrexate is frequently combined with other chemotherapy agents to improve response. This study may help increase the understanding of lenalidomide and nivolumab use in primary CNS lymphoma treatment. In addition, it may help researchers see whether the control of CNS lymphoma can be extended by using these study drugs as maintenance (prolonged therapy) after control is achieved with the initial chemotherapy regimen (induction).",

        "description":"This phase III trial investigates the best dose of vinblastine in combination with selumetinib and the benefit of adding vinblastine to selumetinib compared to selumetinib alone in treating children and young adults with low-grade glioma (a common type of brain cancer) that has come back after prior treatment (recurrent) or does not respond to therapy (progressive). Selumetinib is a drug that works by blocking a protein that lets tumor cells grow without stopping. Vinblastine blocks cell growth by stopping cell division and may kill cancer cells. Giving selumetinib in combination with vinblastine may work better than selumetinib alone in treating recurrent or progressive low-grade glioma.",

        "description":"This phase II\/III trial compares the effect of adding chemotherapy before and after surgery versus after surgery alone (usual treatment) in treating patients with stage II-III gallbladder cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving chemotherapy before surgery may make the tumor smaller; therefore, may reduce the extent of surgery. Additionally, it may make it easier for the surgeon to distinguish between normal and cancerous tissue. Giving chemotherapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. This study will determine whether giving chemotherapy before surgery increases the length of time before the cancer may return and whether it will increase a patient's life span compared to the usual approach.",

T-DM1 is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to a chemotherapy drug, called DM1. Trastuzumab is a form of targeted therapy because it attaches to specific molecules (receptors) on the surface of cancer cells, known as HER2 receptors, and delivers DM1 to kill them. Tucatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving T-DM1 and tucatinib may work better in preventing breast cancer from relapsing in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer compared to T-DM1 alone.",

        "description":"The overall goal of the study is to determine if treatment of a Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) improves the outcomes of patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We showed that MDD is present in 25% of CKD patients and independently associated with progression to End-Stage Kidney Disease, hospitalization, and death. Depression is also associated with lower quality of life (QOL), fatigue, poor sleep, and non-adherence to diet and medications. However, evidence for efficacy and tolerability of commonly-used antidepressant medications or nonpharmacologic treatments are limited in CKD patients. Our group was the first to conduct a double-blind randomized controlled trial for MDD treatment in 201 patients with non-dialysis CKD, and showed that sertraline, a commonly used selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), was no more efficacious than placebo for improving depressive symptoms. It becomes imperative to test novel strategies to treat MDD in CKD. We propose to compare with a control group, the efficacy and tolerability of two novel treatment strategies - (1) Behavioral Activation Teletherapy (BAT) for 16 weeks, with the addition of bupropion, a non-SSRI antidepressant, at 8 weeks for patients whose depression has not remitted (non-remitters); and (2) bupropion for 16 weeks, with the addition of BAT at 8 weeks for non-remitters. In Aim 1, we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of these 2 strategies vs. control for improvement in a primary endpoint of depressive symptoms in 201 patients (67 per group) with non-dialysis CKD stages 3b-5 and MDD at 2 sites, randomized 1:1:1 to either strategy or a control group of Clinical Management plus placebo. We hypothesize that either approach vs. control will result in a minimal clinically important difference of 2 points improvement in depressive symptoms, as ascertained blindly by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology. In Aim 2 we will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of 8 weeks of (1) single-blind BAT plus placebo or (2) double-blind bupropion plus Clinical Management vs. control for improvement in depressive symptoms. In Aim 3, we will compare the efficacy of these 2 treatments strategies vs. control for improvement in CKD patient-centered outcomes including a. adherence to medications and healthcare visits; b. fatigue; c. sleep; and d. overall functioning. A clinical trial is urgently needed to address the evidence gap that exists for MDD treatment in CKD patients.",

        "description":"This phase III trial tests two questions by two separate comparisons of therapies. The first question is whether enhanced therapy (apalutamide in combination with abiraterone + prednisone) added to standard of care (prostate radiation therapy and short term androgen deprivation) is more effective compared to standard of care alone in patients with prostate cancer who experience biochemical recurrence (a rise in the blood level of prostate specific antigen \\[PSA\\] after surgical removal of the prostate cancer).\n\nA second question tests treatment in patients with biochemical recurrence who show prostate cancer spreading outside the pelvis (metastasis) by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. In these patients, the benefit of adding metastasis-directed radiation to enhanced therapy (apalutamide in combination with abiraterone + prednisone) is tested.\n\nDiagnostic procedures, such as PET, may help doctors look for cancer that has spread to the pelvis. Androgens are hormones that may cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Apalutamide may help fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of androgens by the tumor cells. Metastasis-directed targeted radiation therapy uses high energy rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors that have spread. This trial may help doctors determine if using PET results to deliver more tailored treatment (i.e., adding apalutamide, with or without targeted radiation therapy, to standard of care treatment) works better than standard of care treatment alone in patients with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer.",

        "description":"This phase III ALCHEMIST trial tests the addition of pembrolizumab to usual chemotherapy for the treatment of stage IIA, IIB, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer that has been removed by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, pemetrexed, carboplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving pembrolizumab with usual chemotherapy may help increase survival times in patients with stage IIA, IIB, IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung cancer.",

        "description":"This phase III trial compares the effect of bevacizumab and osimertinib combination vs. osimertinib alone for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer that has spread outside of the lungs (stage IIIB-IV) and has a change (mutation) in a gene called EGFR. The EGFR protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival. Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. Bevacizumab is in a class of medications called antiangiogenic agents. It works by stopping the formation of blood vessels that bring oxygen and nutrients to tumor. This may slow the growth and spread of tumor. Giving osimertinib with bevacizumab may control cancer for longer and help patients live longer as compared to osimertinib alone.",

        "description":"This phase III trial studies whether inotuzumab ozogamicin added to post-induction chemotherapy for patients with High-Risk B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL) improves outcomes. This trial also studies the outcomes of patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL), and B-lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LLy) when treated with ALL therapy without inotuzumab ozogamicin. Inotuzumab ozogamicin is a monoclonal antibody, called inotuzumab, linked to a type of chemotherapy called calicheamicin. Inotuzumab attaches to cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers calicheamicin to kill them. Other drugs used in the chemotherapy regimen, such as cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, daunorubicin, methotrexate, leucovorin, mercaptopurine, prednisone, thioguanine, vincristine, and pegaspargase or calaspargase pegol work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. This trial will also study the outcomes of patients with mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) and disseminated B lymphoblastic lymphoma (B-LLy) when treated with high-risk ALL chemotherapy.\n\nThe overall goal of this study is to understand if adding inotuzumab ozogamicin to standard of care chemotherapy maintains or improves outcomes in High Risk B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (HR B-ALL). The first part of the study includes the first two phases of therapy: Induction and Consolidation. This part will collect information on the leukemia, as well as the effects of the initial treatment, to classify patients into post-consolidation treatment groups. On the second part of this study, patients with HR B-ALL will receive the remainder of the chemotherapy cycles (interim maintenance I, delayed intensification, interim maintenance II, maintenance), with some patients randomized to receive inotuzumab. The patients that receive inotuzumab will not receive part of delayed intensification. Other aims of this study include investigating whether treating both males and females with the same duration of chemotherapy maintains outcomes for males who have previously been treated for an additional year compared to girls, as well as to evaluate the best ways to help patients adhere to oral chemotherapy regimens. Finally, this study will be the first to track the outcomes of subjects with disseminated B-cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-LLy) or Mixed Phenotype Acute Leukemia (MPAL) when treated with B-ALL chemotherapy.",

        "description":"Treatment resistant depression remains a major problem for individuals and society. Surgical procedures may provide relief for some of these patients. The most frequently considered surgical approach is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of a part of the brain called the subcallosal cingulate region. However, the effectiveness and safety is not well established. The investigators will use a novel approach using advanced imaging technique (magnetic resonance tractography) to evaluate the feasibility and safety of this surgical approach. An innovative method for the definition of DBS target will be applied that redefines the concept of targeting as one of targeting a symptomatic network rather than a structural brain region using subject-based brain anatomy to define the target location. The correlation between imaging findings at baseline with the mood score changes at different time points of the study will be investigated.",

        "title":"Exploring the Effects of Corticosteroids on the Human Hippocampus",
        "description":"Chronic corticosteroid (CS) exposure is associated with changes in memory and the hippocampus\r\n      in both humans and in animal models. The hippocampus has a high concentration of\r\n      glucocorticoid receptors (GCRs), and the pre-clinical literature demonstrates shortening of\r\n      apical dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus and decreased neurogenesis in the\r\n      dentate gyrus (DG) following CS administration. In humans, both stress and CS exposure are\r\n      associated with a decline in declarative memory performance (a process mediated by the\r\n      hippocampus). Impairment in declarative memory and hippocampal atrophy are reported in\r\n      patients with excessive CS release due to Cushing's disease, and, by our group, in patients\r\n      receiving prescription CS therapy. These findings have important implications for patients\r\n      with mood disorders, as a large subset of people with major depressive disorder (MDD) show\r\n      evidence of HPA axis activation, elevated cortisol and, importantly, resistance to the\r\n      effects of CSs on both the HPA axis and on declarative memory. Thus, resistance to\r\n      corticosteroids appears to be a consequence of MDD.\r\n\r\n      this study will examine changes in declarative memory, as well as use state-of-the-art\r\n      high-resolution multimodal neuroimaging, including structural and functional (i.e.,\r\n      task-based and resting state) MRI, in both men and women healthy controls, and, as an\r\n      exploratory aim, a depressed group, given 3-day exposures to hydrocortisone (160 mg\/day) or\r\n      placebo. The study will translate preclinical findings to humans, provide valuable data on\r\n      possible sex differences in the response to cortisol and, for the first time, identify\r\n      specific hippocampal subfields (e.g., CA3\/DG) in humans that are most sensitive to acute CS\r\n      effects. Using resting state fMRI data and whole brain connectomics using graph theoretical\r\n      approaches, we will determine the effects of cortisol exposure on functional brain networks.\r\n      Furthermore, this will be the first study to use neuroimaging to compare the brain's response\r\n      to CSs in people with depression vs. controls, and determine whether depressed people\r\n      demonstrate glucocorticoid resistance within the hippocampus. We hypothesize that hippocampal\r\n      response to acute CSs will be greatest in the CA3\/DG subfield, greater in women than in men,\r\n      and that depressed people will show a blunted hippocampal response to CSs compared to\r\n      controls. A multidisciplinary research team with extensive experience in CS effects on the\r\n      brain and hippocampal subfield neuroimaging, and a prior history of research collaboration,\r\n      will conduct the project.",

For each of\r\n      the dose levels, transplantation of Q-Cells\u00ae unilaterally into spinal cord demyelinated\r\n      lesions will be evaluated. Subjects will be blinded to side of treatment.\r\n\r\n      Idiopathic Transverse Myelitis is a monophasic disorder characterized predominantly by\r\n      demyelination. Patients are left with disability from damage to ascending and descending\r\n      white matter tracts. Q-Cells\u00ae are comprised of glial progenitor cells.It is postulated that\r\n      the Q-Cells\u00ae glial progeny (healthy astrocytes and oligodendrocytes) will integrate into the\r\n      spinal cord lesion site and remyelinate demyelinated axons as well as provide trophic support\r\n      for damaged axons. Therefore, Q-Cells\u00ae have the potential to repair damage that has occurred\r\n      and could be clinically useful for patients with disability caused by TM.\r\n\r\n      The study is planned to enroll up to 9 subjects. Each subject will be followed for 9 months\r\n      after transplantation of Q-Cells\u00ae. Each subject will receive a single time point\r\n      administration of Q-Cells\u00ae: with transplantation foci targeted to posterior columns in the\r\n      spinal cord (all transplantation foci below C7) on one side.\r\n\r\n      Study participation consists of Screening, Pre-operative\/Treatment, and Post-treatment study\r\n      periods that will generally last from 9 to 12 months in total. The study data will be\r\n      assessed for safety and activity until the last subject has completed the 9-month study\r\n      visit. Following completion of the 9-month follow-up period, subjects who consent will\r\n      continue to be followed for safety and activity in a separate long-term follow-up protocol.",

Eligible tumor types include solid tumors and malignancies in which there is known evidence of clinical activity for single agent PD-1 or PD-L1 antibodies. Nivolumab is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Merkel cell cancer, bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), gastric cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cervical cancer, head and neck cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), metastatic small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and any solid tumor with microsatellite instability (MSI)-high status confirmed. Patients with HL are eligible but must follow standard response criteria. Additional tumor types may be eligible on a case by case basis upon discussion with principal investigator (PI). Patients enrolling on the trial for adjuvant use will be restricted to those with histology for which a PD-1\/PD-L1 inhibitor has been approved in the adjuvant setting including but not limited to NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, cervical cancer, and bladder cancer\n* Patients who have previously received other forms of immunotherapy (high-dose \\[HD\\] IL-2, IFN, CTLA-4) are allowed.

For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. WOCBP receiving nivolumab will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 5 months after the last dose of investigational product. Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with WOCBP will be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of investigational product. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (minimum sensitivity 25 IU\/L or equivalent units of human chorionic gonadotropin \\[HCG\\]) within 24 hours prior to the start of nivolumab. Women must not be breastfeeding. Women who are not of childbearing potential (i.e., who are postmenopausal or surgically sterile as well as azoospermic men) do not require contraception. WOCBP is defined as any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilization (hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy) or who is not postmenopausal. Menopause is defined clinically as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over 45 in the absence of other biological or physiological causes. In addition, women under the age of 55 must have a documented serum follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) level less than 40 mIU\/mL. These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days, and men who are sexually active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she (or the participating partner) should inform the treating physician immediately\n* Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n* Patients with more than one autoimmune disease are eligible.

Asthma prevalence rates have increased in the past decade, affecting 8.4% (25.7 million people) of the United States population. The economic costs of asthma have been estimated annually with $56 billion in the US alone. Despite progress in pharmacological treatment, overall asthma control remains unsatisfactory and treatment non-adherence is extremely high. Asthma is particularly under diagnosed and understudied in aging adults. This problem will increase in coming decades given demographic trends and will disproportionally contribute to the societal and personal economic costs associated with asthma treatment and management. In the proposed 4-year project we will evaluate, in a two-session assessment recruiting a total of 126 asthma patients and 66 healthy controls aged 40-69 years, the extent to which asthma and aging are associated with changes in cognition and brain chemistry, structure, and function.",

        "description":"The investigators want to study if lower doses of chemotherapy will help babies with SCID to achieve good immunity with less short and long-term risks of complications after transplantation. This trial identifies babies with types of immune deficiencies that are most likely to succeed with this approach and offers them transplant early in life before they get severe infections or later if their infections are under control. It includes only patients receiving unrelated or mismatched related donor transplants.\n\nThe study will test if patients receiving transplant using either a low dose busulfan or a medium dose busulfan will have immune recovery of both T and B cells, measured by the ability to respond to immunizations after transplant. The exact regimen depends on the subtype of SCID the patient has. Donors used for transplant must be unrelated or half-matched related (haploidentical) donors, and peripheral blood stem cells must be used. To minimize the chance of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the stem cells will have most, but not all, of the T cells removed, using a newer, experimental approach of a well-established technology. Once the stem cell transplant is completed, patients will be followed for 3 years. Approximately 9-18 months after the transplant, vaccinations will be administered, and a blood test measuring whether your child's body has responded to the vaccine will be collected.",

        "description":"The Dallas 2K is a 10-year natural history, longitudinal, prospective study of a cohort of 2,000 participants that will help uncover the socio-demographic, lifestyle, clinical, psychological and neurobiological factors that contribute to anti-depressant treatment response: remission, recurrence, relapse and individual outcomes in depressive disorders. Hence, the expected duration of this study is 20 years in length. Since this is an observational study, investigators will explore a comprehensive panel of carefully selected participant specific parameters: socio-demographic (age, ethnicity, economic); lifestyle (physical activity, substance use); clinical (medical history, anxious depression, early life trauma), biological (biomarkers in blood, saliva, urine), behavioral (cognitive, emotional), neurophysiological (EEG), and neuroimaging (structural, functional brain circuitry) with the goal to develop the most robust predictive models of treatment response and of depression outcomes. There is no medication or non-medication treatment or intervention provided by this study.\n\nSubjects will have elevated symptomatology of nonpsychotic chronic or recurrent depressive disorder and will be currently receiving or will be prescribed standard of care medication or non-medication based treatments by their providers\/clinicians. The study cohort will reflect the wide range of patients seen in typical primary or psychiatric care settings, and may include unipolar or bipolar disorders and dysthymia (a more chronic form of depression). The cohort will be broadly representative of and generalizable to the US general population as a whole.",

        "description":"The goal of this study is to identify genes that convey susceptibility to congenital\r\n      diaphragmatic hernia in humans. The identification of such genes, and examination of their\r\n      structure and function, will enable a delineation of molecular pathogenesis and, ultimately,\r\n      prevention or treatment of congenital diaphragmatic hernia. There are many different possible\r\n      modes of inheritance for congenital anomalies, including autosomal dominant, autosomal\r\n      recessive, and multifactorial. Multi-factorial inheritance is responsible for many common\r\n      medical disorders, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, diabetes and cancer. This\r\n      type of inheritance pattern appears to involve environmental factors as well as a combination\r\n      of genetic variations that together can predispose to or produce congenital anomalies, such\r\n      as congenital diaphragmatic hernia.\r\n\r\n      Our study is designed to establish a small, well-defined genetic resource consisting of 1)\r\n      Nuclear families suitable for linkage analysis by parametric,non-parametric (e.g. sib pairs,\r\n      TDT) and association techniques, 2) Individuals with congenital diaphragmatic hernia who can\r\n      be directly screened for allelic variation in candidate genes, and 3) Individuals who can\r\n      serve as controls (are unaffected by congenital diaphragmatic hernia). Neonates and their\r\n      families will be collected from homogenous and heterogeneous populations. By characterizing\r\n      diverse populations, it should be possible to increase the likelihood of demonstration of\r\n      genetic variation in selected candidate genes that can then be used in association and\r\n      linkage studies in individual subjects with congenital diaphragmatic hernia.",

Genetic and immunologic factors play a key role in the development of T1DM, and\n      characterization of the early metabolic abnormalities in T1DM is steadily increasing.\n      However, information regarding the natural history of T1DM remains incomplete. The TrialNet\n      Natural History Study of the Development of T1DM (Pathway to Prevention Study) has been\n      designed to clarify this picture, and in so doing, will contribute to the development and\n      implementation of studies aimed at prevention of and early treatment in T1DM.\n\n      Purpose:\n\n      TrialNet is an international network dedicated to the study, prevention, and early treatment\n      of type 1 diabetes. TrialNet sites are located throughout the United States, Canada,\n      Finland, United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Sweden, Australia, and New Zealand. TrialNet is\n      dedicated to testing new approaches to the prevention of and early intervention for type 1\n      diabetes.\n\n      The goal of the TrialNet Natural History Study of the Development of Type 1 Diabetes is to\n      enhance our understanding of the demographic, immunologic, and metabolic characteristics of\n      individuals at risk for developing type 1 diabetes.\n\n      The Natural History Study will screen relatives of people with type 1 diabetes to identify\n      those at risk for developing the disease. Relatives of people with type 1 diabetes have\n      about a 5% percent chance of being positive for the antibodies associated with diabetes.\n      TrialNet will identify adults and children at risk for developing diabetes by testing for\n      the presence of these antibodies in the blood. A positive antibody test is an early\n      indication that damage to insulin-secreting cells may have begun. If this test is positive,\n      additional testing will be offered to determine the likelihood that a person may develop\n      diabetes. Individuals with antibodies will be offered the opportunity for further testing to\n      determine their risk of developing diabetes over the next 5 years and to receive close\n      monitoring for the development of diabetes.",

Given the poor\n      understanding of MCD\/FSGS and MN biology, it is not surprising that the available therapies\n      are imperfect. The therapies lack a clear biological basis, and as many families have\n      experienced, they are often not beneficial, and in fact may be significantly toxic. Given\n      these observations, it is essential that research be conducted that address these serious\n      obstacles to effectively caring for patients.\n\n      In response to a request for applications by the National Institutes of Health, Office of\n      Rare Diseases (NIH, ORD) for the creation of Rare Disease Clinical Research Consortia, a\n      number of affiliated universities joined together with The NephCure Foundation the NIDDK,\n      the ORDR, and the University of Michigan in collaboration towards the establishment of a\n      Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) Rare Diseases Clinical Research Consortium.\n\n      Through this consortium the investigators hope to understand the fundamental biology of\n      these rare diseases and aim to bank long-term observational data and corresponding\n      biological specimens for researchers to access and further enrich.",

        "description":"While cigarette smoking remains the primary cause of most lung cancer cases, lung carcinoma\r\n      in never smokers account for nearly 20 percent of cases. Never smokers with lung cancer\r\n      typically present with different molecular profiles from that of smokers, which results in\r\n      prognostic and therapeutic implications. Molecular changes in NSCLC that have therapeutic\r\n      significance include mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and\r\n      rearrangements in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene. These driver mutations typically\r\n      are present in lung tumors found in never or light smokers.\r\n\r\n      The addition of bevacizumab to carboplatin and paclitaxel in first-line treatment of\r\n      non-squamous NSCLC showed improved survival compared to carboplatin and paclitaxel alone,\r\n      12.3 vs. 10.3 months respectively. Results from the POINTBREAK trial demonstrated that\r\n      carboplatin + pemetrexed + bevacizumab is an alternative option to carboplatin + paclitaxel +\r\n      bevacizumab, with comparable survival but less toxicity. In recent years, immunotherapy has\r\n      emerged as a form of treatment that can lead to robust responses in a subset of patients. The\r\n      PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab and the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab have shown prolonged survival\r\n      in comparison to docetaxel in patients who previously progressed with chemotherapy,\r\n      irrespective of PD-L1 expression. Thus, this study combines immunotherapeutic agent\r\n      atezolozumab with an ant-angiogenic agent, bevacizumab, and double platinum therapy\r\n      (carboplatin and pemetrexed).",

        "title":"Brain Networks and Consciousness",
        "description":"General anesthesia (GA) is a medically induced state of unresponsiveness and unconsciousness,\r\n      which millions of people experience every year. Despite its ubiquity, a clear and consistent\r\n      picture of the brain circuits mediating consciousness and responsiveness has not emerged.\r\n      Studies to date are limited by lack of direct recordings in human brain during medically\r\n      induced anesthesia. Our overall hypothesis is that the current model of consciousness,\r\n      originally proposed to model disorders and recovery of consciousness after brain injury, can\r\n      be generalized to understand mechanisms of consciousness more broadly. This will be studied\r\n      through three specific aims. The first is to evaluate the difference in anesthesia\r\n      sensitivity in patients with and without underlying basal ganglia pathology. Second is to\r\n      correlate changes in brain circuitry with induction and emergence from anesthesia. The third\r\n      aim is to evaluate the effects of targeted deep brain stimulation on anesthesia induced loss\r\n      and recovery of consciousness. This study focuses on experimentally studying these related\r\n      brain circuits by taking advantage of pathological differences in movement disorder patient\r\n      populations undergoing deep brain stimulation (DBS) surgery. DBS is a neurosurgical procedure\r\n      that is used as treatment for movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease and essential\r\n      tremor, and provides a mechanism to acquire brain activity recordings in subcortical\r\n      structures. This study will provide important insight by using human data to shed light on\r\n      the generalizability of the current model of consciousness. The subject's surgery for DBS\r\n      will be prolonged by up to 40 minutes in order to record the participant's brain activity and\r\n      their responses to verbal and auditory stimuli.",

This trial aims to examine the safety of this\r\n      novel agent in pediatric patients with relapsed\/refractory hematologic malignancies.\r\n\r\n      The mechanism by which tagraxofusp kills cells is distinct from that of conventional\r\n      chemotherapy. Tagraxofusp directly targets CD123 that is present on tumor cells, but is\r\n      expressed at lower or levels or absent on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Tagraxofusp also\r\n      utilizes a payload that is not cell cycle dependent, making it effective against both highly\r\n      proliferative tumor cells and also quiescent tumor cells.\r\n\r\n      The rationale for clinical development of tagraxofusp for pediatric patients with hematologic\r\n      malignancies is based on the ubiquitous and high expression of CD123 on many of these\r\n      diseases, as well as the highly potent preclinical activity and robust clinical\r\n      responsiveness in adults observed to date.\r\n\r\n      This trial includes two parts: a monotherapy phase and a combination chemotherapy phase. This\r\n      design will provide further monotherapy safety data and confirm the FDA approved pediatric\r\n      dose, as well as provide safety data when combined with chemotherapy.\r\n\r\n      The goal of this study is to improve survival rates in children and young adults with\r\n      relapsed hematological malignancies, determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of\r\n      tagraxofusp given alone and in combination with chemotherapy, as well as to describe the\r\n      toxicities, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of tagraxofusp in pediatric\r\n      patients.\r\n\r\n      About 54 children and young adults will participate in this study.
