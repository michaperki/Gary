HIV+ Deceased Donor Heart Transplant Study for HIV+ Recipients,"This will be a prospective single-center interventional trial to compare the outcomes of HIV-positive heart transplant recipients by the HIV status of the donor; HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative and learn whether heart organ transplantation from HIV+ deceased donors is as safe and effective in HIV+ recipients as transplants from HIV- deceased donors.

Patient will undergo standard evaluation for eligibility of transplantation by the primary heart transplant team. If patient meets eligibility criteria, they will be informed about the study and consent will be obtained. Informed consent will be obtained in a private clinic or inpatient hospital room in a confidential setting. HIV-positive or HIV-negative offers will be made by Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) (serving as a means of ""natural randomization"" and this information will also be collected, along with the information regarding any information for primary offer declines from the patients as well as other clinical indications to decline an organ offer. As a result of this, there will be two main groups in the study participants that will undergo analysis:

1. patients/recipients that are HIV+ who receive an organ from an HIV+ donor (HIV D+/R+ group)
2. patients/recipients that are HIV+ who receive an organ from an HIV negative donor (HIV D-/R+ group)

Only study participants will be able to receive organ offers from both HIV-positive and HIV-negative organ donors whichever is available first regardless of HIV status. This is the only study intervention. Baseline visit parameters will be obtained during a routine heart transplant visit. There will be no additional procedures or blood collection after the baseline study visit.

Study data will be collected from chart review of routine post-transplant follow-up visits at weeks 52 (1 year), 104 (2 years), and 152 (3 years) after the transplant.","Call 214-648-5005studyfinder@utsouthwestern.edu, Ricardo.LaHoz@UTSouthwestern.edu",Ricardo La Hoz,ALL,18 Years to  old,NA,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06659952,STU-2024-0777,OTHER: HIV-positive heart transplant,"HIV Infection, Advanced End Stage Heart Failure","HIV positive donor, HIV positive recipient, Heart transplant",UT Southwestern,"All individuals with advanced heart failure and HIV infection who meet the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will be eligible for participation in the study.

A Novel Approach for Reducing Hyperoxaluria and Kidney Stone Risk.,"This pilot study is proposing a novel approach to directly target intestinal oxalate absorption with the drug Tenapanor, which was recently FDA-approved for treating hyperphosphatemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Tenapanor works by blocking paracellular phosphate absorption by the intestine, but the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly defined. Since phosphate and oxalate ions are absorbed through the same paracellular pathway, and are of similar size and charge, Tenapanor is hypothesized to also reduce dietary oxalate absorption and consequently lower urinary oxalate excretion.","Call 214-648-5005studyfinder@utsouthwestern.edu, vidiya.srikakulapu@UTSouthwestern.edu",Jonathan Whittamore,ALL,18 Years to 99 Years old,PHASE4,This study is also accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06481150,STU-2023-1257,"DRUG: Tenapanor, OTHER: Placebo",Hyperoxaluria,,UT Southwestern,"* Normal, healthy adult volunteers","* Personal history of kidney stones

A Study to Evaluate the Risk of Tumor Lysis Syndrome (TLS) in Adult Participants Receiving Oral Venetoclax in Combination With Intravenously Infused Obinutuzumab or Oral Acalabrutinib for Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL),"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia (cancer of blood cells). The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib in the treatment of CLL. Adverse events and change in disease activity will be assessed.

Venetoclax in combination with obinutuzumab or acalabrutinib is being investigated in the treatment of CLL. Study doctors put the participants in 1 of 4 groups, called treatment arms. Participants will receive oral venetoclax in combination with intravenously (IV) infused obinutuzumab or oral acalabrutinib at in different dosing schemes as part of treatment. Approximately 120 adult participants with CLL who are being treated with venetoclax will be enrolled in the study in approximately 80 sites worldwide.

Participants in Arm A will receive oral venetoclax in combination with IV infused obinutuzumab, with a 5 week venetoclax ramp up. Participants in Arm B will receive oral venetoclax in combination with oral acalabrutinib, with a 5 week venetoclax ramp up.

A Clinical Study of V940 Treatment and Pembrolizumab in People With Bladder Cancer (V940-005/INTerpath-005),"Researchers are looking for new ways to treat people with high-risk muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma (MIUC). Urothelial carcinoma is a type of bladder cancer that begins in cells that line the inside of the bladder and other parts of the urinary tract, such as part of the kidneys, ureters, and urethra. People with MIUC usually have chemotherapy before surgery, then surgery to remove the cancer. Chemotherapy is a type of medicine to destroy cancer cells or stop them from growing. After surgery, some people receive more treatment to prevent cancer from returning. Pembrolizumab is an immunotherapy, which is a treatment that helps the immune system fight cancer. Enfortumab vedotin (EV) is an antibody drug conjugate (ADC). An ADC attaches to a protein on cancer cells and delivers treatment to destroy those cells. Researchers want to learn if giving V940 (the study treatment) with pembrolizumab can prevent MIUC from returning after surgery. V940 (also called mRNA-4157) is designed to treat each person's cancer by helping the person's immune system identify and kill cancer cells based on certain proteins found on those cancer cells.

The goals of this study are to learn if people who receive V940 and pembrolizumab are alive and cancer free longer than those who receive placebo and pembrolizumab, and to learn about the safety of V940, pembrolizumab, and EV, and if people tolerate them.",Call 833-722-6237canceranswerline@utsouthwestern.edu,Waddah Arafat,ALL,18 Years to  old,PHASE1,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06305767,STU-2024-0447,"BIOLOGICAL: Pembrolizumab, BIOLOGICAL: V940, OTHER: Placebo, BIOLOGICAL: Enfortumab Vedotin, PROCEDURE: Surgery (RC plus PLND)","Bladder Cancer, Urinary Bladder","Programmed Cell Death-1 (PD1, PD-1), Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 1 (PDL1, PD-L1), Programmed Cell Death 1 Ligand 2 (PDL2, PD-L2)",UT Southwestern,"The main inclusion criteria include but are not limited to the following:

Identifying Strategies to Curtail Weight Regain After GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment Cessation,"Longitudinal studies show there is a steep increase in weight regain in the first 3-4 months after stopping GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1s) and most patients regain most of their weight within a year. Insurers now question the utility of GLP-1s for weight loss as they are hesitant to cover these costs long-term (\~$833 per person per month). Some patients would also prefer not to take these medications in perpetuity and are likely to struggle with lifelong adherence. These challenges present an opportunity to test alternative interventions, such as meal replacements and behavioral treatments, to support weight maintenance after successful weight loss with GLP-1s. This regimen would allow patients to benefit from significant weight loss in the first year of taking GLP-1s and use more cost effective and sustainable strategies for long-term maintenance.","Call 214-648-5005studyfinder@utsouthwestern.edu, Carolyn.Haskins@UTSouthwestern.edu",Kelseanna Hollis-Hansen,ALL,18 Years and over,NA,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06273163,STU-2023-1168,"OTHER: Medically tailored meals, BEHAVIORAL: Noom®, OTHER: Usual care",Obesity,"Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists, Body Weight Maintenance",UT Southwestern,,

"Dinutuximab With Chemotherapy, Surgery and Stem Cell Transplantation for the Treatment of Children With Newly Diagnosed High Risk Neuroblastoma","This phase III trial tests how well the addition of dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy works for treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma. Dinutuximab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a molecule called GD2, which is found on the surface of neuroblastoma cells, but is not present on many healthy or normal cells in the body. When dinutuximab binds to the neuroblastoma cells, it helps signal the immune system to kill the tumor cells. This helps the cells of the immune system kill the cancer cells, this is a type of immunotherapy. When chemotherapy and immunotherapy are given together, during the same treatment cycle, it is called chemoimmunotherapy. This clinical trial randomly assigns patients to receive either standard chemotherapy and surgery or chemoimmunotherapy (chemotherapy plus dinutuximab) and surgery during Induction therapy. Chemotherapy drugs administered during Induction include, cyclophosphamide, topotecan, cisplatin, etoposide, vincristine, and doxorubicin. These drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing or by stopping them from spreading. Upon completion of 5 cycles of Induction therapy, a disease evaluation is completed to determine how well the treatment worked. If the tumor responds to therapy, patients receive a tandem transplantation with stem cell rescue. If the tumor has little improvement or worsens, patients receive chemoimmunotherapy on Extended Induction. During Extended Induction, dinutuximab is given with irinotecan, temozolomide. Patients with a good response to therapy move on to Consolidation therapy, when very high doses of chemotherapy are given at two separate points to kill any remaining cancer cells. Following, transplant, radiation therapy is given to the site where the cancer originated (primary site) and to any other areas that are still active at the end of Induction. The final stage of therapy is Post-Consolidation. During Post-Consolidation, dinutuximab is given with isotretinoin, with the goal of maintaining the response achieved with the previous therapy. Adding dinutuximab to Induction chemotherapy along with standard of care surgical resection of the primary tumor, radiation, stem cell transplantation, and immunotherapy may be better at treating children with newly diagnosed high-risk neuroblastoma.",Call 833-722-6237canceranswerline@utsouthwestern.edu,Tanya Watt,ALL,to 30 Years old,PHASE3,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06172296,STU-2024-0471,"PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection, PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Aspiration, PROCEDURE: Bone Marrow Biopsy, DRUG: Carboplatin, DRUG: Cisplatin, PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography, DRUG: Cyclophosphamide, BIOLOGICAL: Dinutuximab, DRUG: Doxorubicin, PROCEDURE: Echocardiography Test, DRUG: Etoposide, PROCEDURE: FDG-Positron Emission Tomography and Computed Tomography Scan, PROCEDURE: Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation, DRUG: Irinotecan, DRUG: Isotretinoin, PROCEDURE: Leukapheresis, PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, DRUG: Melphalan, PROCEDURE: Multigated Acquisition Scan, RADIATION: Radiation Therapy, PROCEDURE: Radionuclide Imaging, OTHER: Survey Administration, DRUG: Temozolomide, DRUG: Thiotepa, DRUG: Topotecan, PROCEDURE: Tumor Resection, DRUG: Vincristine","Ganglioneuroblastoma, Nodular, Neuroblastoma, Brain and Nervous System",,Children’s Health,"* Patients must be enrolled on APEC14B1 and have consented to testing through the Molecular Characterization Initiative (MCI), prior to enrollment on ANBL2131

Intra-nasal Ketorolac for Acute Ureteral Stent-associated Pain Following Ureteroscopy for Stone Disease,"Objective: To improve quality-of-life and health care delivery to patients receiving ureteral stents.

Specific Aims: Evaluate the feasibility, practicality, and qualitative outcomes of utilizing intra-nasal ketorolac in patients with indwelling ureteral stents (Phase I), followed by a randomized trial comparing two non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, intra-nasal Ketorolac versus oral Diclofenac.

Hypotheses: Due to its favorable pharmacokinetics in relieving acute pain, investigators expect improved pain scores and a lower rate of unplanned clinical encounters in patients receiving intra-nasal ketorolac compared to those taking oral diclofenac following ureteroscopic surgery for urolithiasis.

Study Rationale: Following ureteroscopic management of urolithiasis, patient with indwelling ureter stents have higher levels of discomfort compared to those without a ureter stent. Prior studies showed that intramuscular Ketorolac at time of ureter stent removal decreased the incidence of unplanned clinical encounters. Furthermore, onset of analgesic effect by intra-nasal ketorolac is faster than its oral form, and similar its intramuscular and intravenous counterparts.","Call 214-648-5005studyfinder@utsouthwestern.edu, Isaac.Palma-Zamora@UTSouthwestern.edu",Brett Johnson,ALL,18 Years and over,PHASE1,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06158620,STU-2023-0775,"DRUG: intra-nasal ketorolac, DRUG: oral diclofenac","Post Operative Pain, Urolithiasis, Ureter Calculi, Stent Complication, Kidney",,UT Southwestern,"* ≥18 years old

PET/MR for Characterization of Renal Masses (RMs),"The frequency of kidney tumors found incidentally on imaging studies performed for unrelated reasons continues to increase leading to more surgeries and ablations for the treatment of renal masses thought to be cancer. However, about 20% of these masses are not cancerous and do not require treatment. Many cancerous kidney tumors are indolent and can be followed safely with imaging (i.e., particularly tumors \<2 cm and in patients with limited life expectancy), while some tumors are both malignant and aggressive, with a higher potential to spread outside the kidney and require treatment.

The purpose of this observational study is to assess the ability of Fludeoxyglucose (18F) (FDG) PET/MR to distinguish different types of kidney tumors. The investigators hypothesize that PET/MR will better show differences between aggressive and both indolent and benign kidney masses compared to the currently used radiologic scans.

Participants will be selected from those who have been scheduled to receive a contrast-enhanced MRI for their regular care due to a suspicious kidney mass. Participants will have their MRI on a hybrid PET/MR scanner capable of obtaining both MRI and PET images. While they are receiving their standard of care MRI exam, patients will also receive a research FDG PET exam. Participants will have an IV placed for administration of the MRI contrast agent, just as they would if they were not taking part in the study. The same IV will be used to give the FDG radiopharmaceutical for the PET scan and furosemide (a diuretic), to help empty the bladder before the scan and help better see the kidneys on the scans. Both FDG and furosemide are FDA approved medications. Participants will have only one visit with the research team which will last \~2.5 hours and will include collection of the participant's regularly scheduled MRI.

If participants undergo surgery to remove the tumor, the study will collect samples of the removed tissue for research. If participants receive a biopsy of the tumor, the study may collect an additional sample of the tumor for research.

After the PET/MRI, participants will not have additional visits with the study team, but the study team may call every 6-12 months for up to 2 years to see how they are doing and ask about their health. The study team will review the medical record for any changes to their diagnosis, updates to their medical history, new scans ordered by their regular doctor, or recent lab or biopsy results.","Call 214-648-5005studyfinder@utsouthwestern.edu, victoria.reid@UTSouthwestern.edu",Ivan Pedrosa,ALL,18 Years and over,,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT06076538,STU-2022-1158,DIAGNOSTIC_TEST: 2-Deoxy-2-[18F]fluoroglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Magnetic Resonance Imaging,"Renal Tumor, Renal Cell Carcinoma, Renal Tumor, Benign, Kidney","Renal Mass, Renal Cell Carcinoma, PET/MR",UT Southwestern,"* Patients with known solid (\>25% total volume enhances) renal mass

"Testing the Role of DNA Released From Tumor Cells Into the Blood in Guiding the Use of Immunotherapy After Surgical Removal of the Bladder for Bladder Cancer Treatment, MODERN Study","This phase II/III trial examines whether patients who have undergone surgical removal of bladder, but require an additional treatment called immunotherapy to help prevent their bladder cancer from coming back, can be identified by a blood test. Many types of tumors tend to lose cells or release different types of cellular products including their DNA which is referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) into the bloodstream before changes can be seen on scans. Health care providers can measure the level of ctDNA in blood or other bodily fluids to determine which patients are at higher risk for disease progression or relapse. In this study, a blood test is used to measure ctDNA and see if there is still cancer somewhere in the body after surgery and if giving a treatment will help eliminate the cancer. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab and relatlimab, can help the body's immune system to attack the cancer, and can interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial may help doctors determine if ctDNA measurement in blood can better identify patients that need additional treatment, if treatment with nivolumab prolongs patients' life and whether the additional immunotherapy treatment with relatlimab extends time without disease progression or prolongs life of bladder cancer patients who have undergone surgical removal of their bladder.",Call 833-722-6237canceranswerline@utsouthwestern.edu,Tian Zhang,ALL,18 Years and over,PHASE2,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT05987241,STU-2024-0089,"PROCEDURE: Biospecimen Collection, OTHER: cfDNA or ctDNA Measurement, PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography, PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, BIOLOGICAL: Nivolumab, OTHER: Quality-of-Life Assessment, OTHER: Questionnaire Administration, BIOLOGICAL: Relatlimab","Muscle Invasive Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma, Stage II Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma AJCC v6 and v7, Stage III Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma AJCC v6 and v7, Stage IV Bladder Urothelial Carcinoma AJCC v7, Urinary Bladder",,UT Southwestern,"* PRE-REGISTRATION: Histologically confirmed muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

"Testing the Combination of Two Anticancer Drugs M1774 (Tuvusertib) and Avelumab to Evaluate Their Safety and Effectiveness in Treating Merkel Cell Skin Cancer, MATRiX Trial","This phase II trial compares tuvusertib in combination with avelumab to tuvusertib alone to determine whether the combination therapy will lengthen the time before the cancer starts getting worse in patients with Merkel cell cancer that has not responded to previous treatment (refractory). Tuvusertib is a drug that inhibits an enzyme called ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) kinase, which is an enzyme that plays a role in repair of damaged deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as well as tumor cell replication and survival. It may lead to tumor cell death by inhibiting ATR kinase activity. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as avelumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

Patients with endocrinopathies requiring hormone replacement (such as hypothyroidism, autoimmune diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency) will be allowed
* CROSSOVER EXCLUSION: M1774/ tuvusertib is primarily metabolized by aldehyde oxidase and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 and CYP1A2; therefore, concomitant administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir) and CYP1A2 or inducers of CYP3A4 (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's Wort) and CYP1A2 are prohibited. M1774/ tuvusertib is an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2K and substrates of these transporters are also prohibited. These include metformin, acyclovir, estrone sulfate, ciprofloxacin and cephalexin. Patients who are taking such medications who cannot discontinue or switch them to an acceptable alternative are not eligible. Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated medical reference for a list of drugs to avoid or minimize use of.

Sonocloud-9 in Association With Carboplatin Versus Standard-of-Care Chemotherapies (CCNU or TMZ) in Recurrent GBM (SONOBIRD),"The brain is protected from any toxic or inflammatory molecule by the blood-brain barrier (BBB). This physical barrier is located at the level of the blood vessel walls. Because of these barrier properties, the blood vessels are also impermeable to the passage of therapeutic molecules from the blood to the brain. The development of effective treatments against glioblastoma is thus limited due to the BBB that prevents most drugs injected in the bloodstream from getting into brain tissue where the tumour is seated. The SonoCloud-9 (SC9) is an investigational device using ultrasound technology and specially developed to open the BBB in the area of and surrounding the tumour. The transient opening of the BBB allows more drugs to reach the brain tumour tissue. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy that is approved to treat different cancer types alone or in combination with other drugs, and has been used in the treatment of glioblastoma. Despite its proven efficacy in the laboratory on glioblastoma cells, carboplatin does not readily cross the BBB in humans. A clinical trial has shown that in combination with the SonoCloud-9, more carboplatin can reach the brain tumour tissue. The objective of the proposed trial is to show that the association - carboplatin with the SonoCloud-9 - will increase efficacy of the drug in patients with recurrent glioblastoma.",Call 833-722-6237canceranswerline@utsouthwestern.edu,Toral Patel,ALL,18 Years to  old,PHASE3,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT05902169,STU-2023-1253,"DEVICE: SonoCloud-9 (SC9), DRUG: Carboplatin, DRUG: Lomustine, DRUG: Temozolomide","Glioblastoma, Recurrent Glioblastoma, GBM, Brain and Nervous System","carboplatin, SonoCloud, blood-brain barrier, Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPU)",UT Southwestern,"• Histologically proven glioblastoma (WHO criteria 2021), absence of IDH mutation demonstrated by negative IDH1 R132H staining on Immunohistochemistry. • Patient must have received prior first line therapy that must have contained both: • Prior surgery or biopsy and standard fractionated radiotherapy (1.8-2 Gy/fraction, \>56 Gy\<66 Gy) or hypofractionated radiotherapy (15 x 2.66 Gy or similar regimen) • One line of maintenance chemotherapy and/or immune- or biological therapy, (with or without Tumor-Treating Fields) • First, unequivocal disease progression with • measurable tumor (\>100 mm2 or 1 cm3, based on RANO criteria) documented (e.g., increase of 25% in tumor diameter) on MRI performed within 14 days of inclusion and, • interval of a minimum of 12 weeks since the completion of prior radiotherapy, unless there is a new lesion outside the radiation field or unequivocal evidence of viable tumor on histopathological sampling • Patient is candidate for craniotomy and at least 50% resection of enhancing region • Maximal enhancing tumor diameter prior to inclusion ≤ 5 cm on T1w.

"Focused Radiation Versus Systemic Therapy for Kidney Cancer Patients With Limited Metastasis, SOAR Study","This phase III trial compares the effect of stero-ablative radiotherapy (SAbR) followed by standard of care systemic therapy, to standard of care systemic therapy alone, in patients with kidney cancer that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to a limited (2-5) number of places in the body (metastatic). Study doctors want to find out if this approach is better or worse than the usual approach for metastatic kidney cancer. The usual approach is defined as the care most people get for metastatic kidney cancer which includes systemic therapy such as immunotherapy (given through the veins) and/or small molecular inhibitor (tablets taken by mouth). Radiotherapy uses high energy x-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. SAbR uses special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision. Giving SAbR prior to systemic therapy may kill more tumor cells than the usual approach, which is systemic therapy alone.",Call 833-722-6237canceranswerline@utsouthwestern.edu,Qian Qin,ALL,18 Years and over,PHASE3,This study is NOT accepting healthy volunteers,NCT05863351,STU-2023-1029,"PROCEDURE: Computed Tomography, PROCEDURE: Magnetic Resonance Imaging, OTHER: Questionnaire Administration, PROCEDURE: Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy, PROCEDURE: Systemic Therapy","Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma, Stage IV Renal Cell Cancer AJCC v8, Kidney",,UT Southwestern,"* Patient must be \>= 18 years of age
